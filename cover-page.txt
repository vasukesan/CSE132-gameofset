Tell us about your protocol:
The GUI responds to player inputs by enqueueing commands which continually are checked for and sent to the server in Client.
In a separate thread, Client is continually reading reading bytes, waiting for the correct message header and then
 responding with changes to the GUI based on the message type.
The server accepts the connection from the Client (starts a thread) and keeps a Set of all the SetMsgOutputStreams.
 It takes the information from the SetMsgInputStream of each Client and writes back to every Client using the set of 
 output streams. 



If there is anything else we should know about your work on this assignment, 
please explain here:
"No Cards Available" JButton adds cards regardless of whether there is a set of not. Max number of 18 cards on the field. 
	We thought this was the most realistic way of playing. 
A popup comes up for an individual player if an incorrect set was called. 
If no cards available is called and the Deck is empty, the winner is announced to all players.
